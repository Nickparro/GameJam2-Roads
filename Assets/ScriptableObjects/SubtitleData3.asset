  subtitleText: 'My senses are on high alert, every creak of a broken branch beneath
    my feet or the rustle of a nocturnal animal sends a shiver down my spine. Sometimes,
    the shadows seem to come alive, dancing among the trees as if they were entities
    of their own, playing with my mind and sowing doubt about what is real and what
    is not.
