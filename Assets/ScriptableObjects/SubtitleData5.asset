  subtitleText: "As I advance, time seems to distort, as if the forest itself were
    a living entity playing with my perceptions. Every shadow takes on a menacing
    shape, every whisper becomes a sinister murmur urging me to turn and run. But
    I press on, driven by the need to find that gas station that shines like a beacon
    in the darkness, a hope amidst the uncertainty that surrounds me.\"\r"
