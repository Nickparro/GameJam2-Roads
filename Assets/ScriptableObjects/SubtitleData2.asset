  subtitleText: "The trees rise imposingly around me, their twisted branches intertwining
    to form a dark roof that barely lets the moonlight through. Each step I take
    seems to plunge me deeper into the thick forest, and the sound of my footsteps
    is lost in the disturbing silence that envelops everything. The rain falls incessantly,
    creating a constant murmur that mingles with the whispering of the wind through
    the trees.\r"
