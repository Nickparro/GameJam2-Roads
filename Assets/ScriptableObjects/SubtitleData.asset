  subtitleText: I've been driving for hours. My car comes to a sudden stop. The gas
    light comes on to warn that I've run out, and there's no sign of a service station
    in sight. Suddenly, in the distance, I spot a sign faintly flashing in the darkness.
    'Service Station 1 kilometer away'. With renewed hope, I head into the dark forest.
